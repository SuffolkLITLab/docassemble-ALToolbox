  Text fields with a character counter
subquestion: |
  The regular **text/area** fields show an error when your inputs exceeded the maxlength.<br><br>
  The **textC/areaC** fields added a character counter, which will show you how many characters you have entered as you type. If your input exceeded the limit, the message is handy as you adjust your input.<br><br>
  Per Jonathan we cannot access maxlength via code, that's why the counter message cannot display how many characters are left.
  
fields:
  - Normal text type: text1
    datatype: text  
    maxlength: 5
  - Text with counter: text2
    datatype: textC  
    maxlength: 7    
  - Normal area type: area1
    datatype: area  
    maxlength: 5
  - Textarea with counter: area2
    datatype: areaC  
    maxlength: 8
