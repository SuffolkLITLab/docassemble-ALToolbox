question: |
  Regular datatype vs ThreePartsDate datatype.
subquestion: | 
  This example shows you how to use the **ThreePartsDate** datatype.<br/><br/>
  ThreePartsDate is good for dates such as a birth date where it's easier for a user to type than to use a long dropdown, or when a browser doesn't honor a datepicker.  
  
  The BirthDate datatype is like ThreePartsDate, but it adds
  validation so that you cannot enter dates in the future.

  - When is your high school graduation?: date_of_graduation
    datatype: ThreePartsDate

    required: False
  - Validated birth: date_of_birth
