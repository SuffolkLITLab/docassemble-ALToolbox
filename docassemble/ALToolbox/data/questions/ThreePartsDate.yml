question: |
  Regular datatype vs ThreePartsDate datatype.
subquestion: | 
  This example shows you how to use the `ThreePartsDate` datatype and the `BirthDate` datatype. You can look at the source code of this page for detailed examples. You also need to add the "al_split_date.css" file to your features block, like this:
  
  <pre><code>
  features:
    css: al_split_date.css
  </code></pre>
  
  <br/>
  A date like this is good for dates such as a passport date, where it's easier for a user to type than to navigate to a date that might be far in the past or future, or when a browser doesn't honor a datepicker.
  
  You can give your dates custom min and max values using the attributes `alMin:` and `alMax:` instead of the usual docassemble min and max attributes. Give the value as a US date - mm/dd/yyyy. For example, `alMax: 12/31/2040`. You can also use Mako.

fields:
  - note: |
      This first field has a min date of today and a max date of 12/31/2040.
  - When will your high school graduation be?: date_of_graduation
    datatype: ThreePartsDate
    required: False
    alMin: ${ today(format='MM/dd/yyyy') }
    alMax: 12/31/2040
    default: 02/3/2040
  - note: |
      The `BirthDate` datatype is like `ThreePartsDate`, but it stops users entering dates in the future.
  - Birth date (today is valid): date_of_birth
    datatype: BirthDate
    required: True
    validation messages:
      required: This is a custom 'required' message.
  - note: |
      These fields can be hidden just like any docassemble field.
  - Show hidden date fields: show_fields
    datatype: yesno
  - Court date: court_date
    datatype: ThreePartsDate
    default: ${ today(format='MM/dd/yyyy') }
    required: True
    show if: show_fields
  - Date you lost your first tooth: tooth_date
    datatype: BirthDate
    required: False
    show if: show_fields

question: |
  Custom validation messages
subquestion: |
  You can choose to give your own custom validation messages if you want, so they can be translatable for on-page validations. When a user press to continue, though, they will get different messages that we can't customize yet.
  
  * `alDefaultMessage` will show instead of any of Assembly Line's default messages for any invalid input as long as you haven't given a more specific message to use.
  * `alMinMessage` will show when the user has put a date too far in the past, overriding the default messages.
  * `alMaxMessage` will show when the user has put a date too far in the future, overriding the default messages.
  * `alInvalidDayMessage` will show when a user has put too many days in a month, overriding the default messages. For example, 2/30/2020.
  * `alInvalidYearMessage` will show when a year is less than 4 digits long or starts with "0", overriding the default messages.

  The fields below have a min date of today and a max date of 12/31/2080.
fields:
  - note: |
      This field just has a custom default message. The message will be the same for any invalid input.
  - When will your 50th anniversary be?: anniversary_date
    datatype: ThreePartsDate
    required: False
    default: 02/3/2035
    alMin: ${ today() }
    alMax: 12/31/2080
    alDefaultMessage: ${ word('Custom alDefaultMessage.') }
  - note: |
      This field has a different custom message for every kind of invalid input.
  - When do you hope to retire?: retirement_date
    datatype: ThreePartsDate
    required: False
    default: 02/3/2055
    alMin: ${ today() }
    alMax: 12/31/2080
    alMinMessage: ${ word('Custom alMinMessage.') }
    alMaxMessage: ${ word('Custom alMaxMessage.') }
    alInvalidDayMessage: ${ word('Custom alInvalidDayMessage.') }
    alInvalidYearMessage: ${ word('Custom alInvalidYearMessage.') }
