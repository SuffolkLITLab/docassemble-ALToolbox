question: |
  Regular datatype vs ThreePartsDate datatype.
subquestion: | 
  This example shows you how to use the **ThreePartsDate** datatype. You can look at the source code for details. You also need to add the "al_split_date.css" file to your features block, like this:
  
  <pre><code>

  features:
    css: al_split_date.css

  </code></pre>
  
  <br/><br/>
  ThreePartsDate is good for dates such as a birth date where it's easier for a user to type than to use a long dropdown, or when a browser doesn't honor a datepicker.  
  
  The BirthDate datatype is like ThreePartsDate, but it adds
  validation so that you cannot enter dates in the future.

fields:
  - When will your high school graduation be?: date_of_graduation
    datatype: ThreePartsDate
    required: False
  - Birth date (today is valid): date_of_birth
    datatype: BirthDate
    required: True
  - Show hidden date fields: show_fields
    datatype: yesno
  - Court date: court_date
    datatype: ThreePartsDate
    default: ${ today(format='MM/dd/yyyy') }
    required: True
    show if: show_fields
  - Date you lost your first tooth: tooth_date
    datatype: BirthDate
    required: False
    show if: show_fields
