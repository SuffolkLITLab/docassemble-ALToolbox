  This file helps you determine which parts of your interview take a long time to run.

  It generates a python [profile stats file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#profile.Profile.dump_stats)
  that you can download and view locally. If you are running python locally, I highly recommend using 
  [venvs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

  * Linux (Ubuntu tested), using a combiation of [kcachegrind](https://kcachegrind.github.io/html/Home.html)
    pyprof2calltree is very effective. You can install and use there tool with the below commands:

    ```
    sudo apt install kcachegrind
    pip install pyprof2calltree

    pyprof2calltree -i ~/Downloads/test.prof -k
    ```

  * On Mac, using [snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) is recommended.
    The following should work (inside or outside of a venv):

    ```
    python3 -m pip install snakeviz
    # test.prof is the name of the downloaded profile file.
    python3 -m snakeviz ~/Downloads/test.prof
    ```

  * Windows: untested, but just install snakeviz however you install python packages

  Put the below in the question that asks for the thing you're trying to time. 
  For example, al_user_bundle, or tenant_repair_letter_bundle

  question: |
    Your documents are ready  ${start_profile}
  subquestion: |

    [Profiling Report](${ download_profile.url_for() })
    ${ stop_profile }
