question: |  
  Add overflow text as an addendum for a PDF main form
subquestion: |
  If your main template is a PDF file, which cannot handle conditions, and your text fields contain text that is too long to display on your form, you will need to add an **addendum docx template file**. 
  
  This interview will show you how to call the 'addenda' module and display the complete text in your addendum docx file, while show a cut-off version of the text in the main form. You want to copy "text-addendum-to-pdf.docx" used in this interview, and change the headings to fit your project.
  
  If your main form is an docx file, see the other yml file "Addenda - text too long for docx form" in this package.

  #1. Put text fields into a list: the 1st element is the variable, the 2nd one is the text limit on the main form, and the 3rd one is the title above the text. 
  tmpList = myTextList(other_relief, 40, 'PART J(5). Losses suffered by the Plaintiff')
  txtList1 = tmpList.txtList
  other_relief_cutoff = tmpList.text_cutoff #to be used in the pdf main form
  
  tmpList = myTextList(losses, 35, 'PART J(8). Other order requested')
  txtList2 = tmpList.txtList
  losses_cutoff = tmpList.text_cutoff #to be used in the pdf main form
  
  #2 Merge the above lists into txtFieldsList (standard name used in addendum)
  txtFieldsList = txtList1 + txtList2
  
  #3. Check if we should invoke the addendum
  addAddendum = bool(txtFieldsList)
