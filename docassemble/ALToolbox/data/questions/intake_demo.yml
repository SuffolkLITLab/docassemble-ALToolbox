  PROTOCOLS FOR HOUSING INTAKES

  Housing is focusing on eviction lawsuits. Thus, we ask workers to do intakes on court 
  matters only. (There are a few exceptions listed below.)

  Court Summons The court matters we will mostly take are cases with summons dates, 
  (first court date, non-trial date). This includes subsidized housing and private 
  landlord/tenant as usual.

  Other Court Matters 
  
  We will also take default judgments, consent judgments, cases 
  already set for trial, and sheriff evictions with the following limitations. 
  Default Judgment: If caller contacts us within Ten (10) calendar days from the 
  date of the default judgment, then please do the intake.

  Cases Already set for Trial: If the caller contacts LSEM at least Ten (10) calendar 
  days from the date of the trial, then it is OK to do the intake.

  Sheriff Evictions Posted and Consent Judgments: Call and/or email me before
  doing the intake. We will take these, but are limited based on the specific facts of 
  the case, which I have to look at before agreeing to open a case.
  
  
  Section 8
  Please do an intake for a caller facing a proposed termination of Section 8, i.e. if the 
  caller has received a proposed termination of Section 8 notice from their local housing authority.

  Domestic Violence
  If domestic violence is present, they should call for a full screening.

  Other Housing Matters
  For other Housing matters, please refer the caller to the Housing section of
  our website.
