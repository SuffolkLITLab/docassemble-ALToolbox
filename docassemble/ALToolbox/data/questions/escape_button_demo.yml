  Escape button demo
subquestion: |
  The escape button goes to google.com. It will be in the nav bar on both wide and narrow screens.

  It overrides the default screen part `navigation bar html`.
  If you would like to combine the "Escape" button with a custom link in the
  top navigation bar, you can do so by adding mandatory block like this:

  <pre>
  <code>
  ---
  mandatory: True
  variable name: al_navigation_items["my_link"]
  data: |
    &lt;div class="nav-item"&gt;&lt;a class="btn" href="https://google.com"&gt;My link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  </code>
  </pre>

  And making sure that it runs on a line before you `include` the `escape_button.yml` file.

  **WARNING:** When you are creating content that goes in the nav bar, like your organization's title, be aware it might interfere with the spacing and location of the escape button.
