comment: |
  To create a custom version, such as when you want show additional items at the top of the page, you can add the variable `al_escape_button_html` to your `default screen parts:`.
  
  Make sure you only include this escape button plugin above that custom block. Otherwise our version will override yours:
  
  ```

  include:
    - escape_button.yml

  default screen parts:
    pre: |
     My additional text
     
     ${ al_escape_button_html_pre }

  ```
