  This feature requires JavaScript on the multiselect that you want to 
  transform into a filterable dropdown. 
  
  Apply the .multiselect() function to the input, with any desired parameters.
  Note you will need to use the base64-encoded version of the input's name because
  of the way Docassemble transforms input names.
  
  Example:  
  
  script: |
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('#bXNlbGVjdA').multiselect({enableCaseInsensitiveFiltering: true, inheritClass: true});
        });
    </script>
