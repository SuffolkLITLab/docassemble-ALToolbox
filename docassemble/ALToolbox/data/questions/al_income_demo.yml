id: which to test
# TODO: Accumulate them all in one ALIncomeList at the end to test the ability of ALIncomeList to run its functions appropriately on all types of values (other than ALIncomeLists themselves)
# TODO: Check these: Does ALAssetList cover all of ALIncomeList? Does ALAsset cover all of ALIncome?
question: |
  Which functionality do you want to try?
subquestion: |
  Before choosing what to test:
  
  * `ALItemizedJobList` covers all the same functionality as `ALItemizedJob`.
  * `ALIncomeList` covers all the same functionality as `ALIncome`.
  * `ALAsset` covers all the same functionality as `ALIncome`.
  * `ALAssetList` covers all the same functionality as `ALAsset`, `ALIncomeList`, `ALIncome`.
  * `ALJob` covers all the same functionality as `ALIncome`.
  * `ALJobList` covers all the same functionality as `ALJob` and `ALIncome`.
  * `ALAsset` covers all the same functionality as `ALIncome`.
  * `ALAssetList` covers all the same functionality as `ALAsset` and `ALIncome`.
  * `ALVehicleList` covers all the same functionality as `ALVehicle`.
  * `ALSimpleValueList` covers all the same functionality as `ALSimpleValue`.
  
  Each item will only demo its own capabilities and those of the classes from which it inherits. It does not show additional features that you can add. For example, an individual ALAsset won't ask for a market value as it has no methods for calculating a market value. An ALAssetList, though, will demo summing up market values using the filters it has in its method.

  Notes on itemized job items:
  
  - commission, bonus, hourly wage, salary, overtime
  - https://fingercheck.com/the-difference-between-a-paycheck-and-a-pay-stub/
  - Deductions are the amounts subtracted or withheld from the total pay, including the income tax percentage of an employeeâ€™s gross wages.
  - Social security and Medicare are deducted based on the income over the set threshold.
  - Other deductions can include state and local income taxes, employee 401K contributions, insurance payments, profit sharing, union dues, garnishments and unemployment insurance etc.
