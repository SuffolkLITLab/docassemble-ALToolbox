# ALToolbox

This project is used to host custom-built modules, js files etc. The purpose is to provide a toolbox so that other coders can call these code in their interview.

If you want to add a small fuction to this project, consider adding it to the existing misc.py to avoid creating too many module files.

## Documentation

Read the [documentation for the functions and components](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/framework/altoolbox) to learn
how to use these components in your own [Docassemble](https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble] projects.
